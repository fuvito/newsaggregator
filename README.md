# News Aggregator
A Legislative News Aggregator where users can view the latest news articles related to state legislations and filter the news by specific states or legislative topics (e.g., education, health, transportation).

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Running on Local Environment 

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Development Notes
* **States and Topics**: As the items for this lists are not going to change (at least not quite often), instead of retrieving them from a database they are going to be kept in the system as a array of objects. They can be used anywhere by importing needed list. Additionaly ***Proof of Concept*** views with menu items are added to the application, which in production version they need to be hidden / removed.
* **3rd Party API Calls**: This function was also added (tobe added) to the system as a ***Proof of Concept*** manner in a specific view and with manual triggering. It should be enhanced and should be controlled by some other an automation.
* **Caching**: Caching was not implemented, NextJs provides some basic level of caching (https://nextjs.org/docs/14/app/building-your-application/caching), can be configured more


## System Design Considerations
### News Aggregation: Data Management for Third-Party Sources

#### Separation of Concerns:
* It's essential to decouple data presentation and data collection into separate applications. This architectural decision enhances maintainability and scalability.
* For each third-party data source, consider creating dedicated instances or modules to isolate potential issues and prevent cascading failures. This approach ensures that problems with one source don't impact the availability or performance of others.

#### Efficient Data Retrieval:
* Leverage the metadata provided by third-party sources (e.g., publication date and time) to optimize data retrieval. By querying for articles published since the last retrieval, we can minimize redundant data and focus on new content.
* Unique identifiers assigned to articles by the source can be used to detect and manage duplicate records within our system. Depending on our requirements, we can either ignore duplicate entries or replace existing records with updated versions.

#### Source Attribution:
* Maintaining source information for each article is crucial for transparency and traceability. This may require modifying our database schema to accommodate source metadata.
#### Additional Considerations:
* **Error Handling and Logging**: Implement robust error handling and logging mechanisms to capture and track issues during data retrieval and processing.
* **Data Validation**: Validate data from third-party sources to ensure accuracy and consistency.
* **Security**: Protect sensitive data by implementing appropriate security measures, such as encryption and access control.
* **Scalability**: Design our data management solution to handle increasing data volumes and evolving requirements.
* **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Regularly monitor the performance and health of our data pipelines, and perform maintenance tasks as needed.

By incorporating these best practices, ou can create a reliable and efficient data management system that effectively integrates data from multiple third-party sources.


### Scalability: Handling Thousands of News Articles Across Multiple States and Topics

To ensure our system can efficiently handle thousands of news articles across multiple states and topics, we will implement a robust and scalable architecture. This will include indexing strategies, efficient storage solutions, and data partitioning techniques.Indexing for Efficient Retrieval

We will implement indexing on crucial fields like state, topic, and publication date to enable rapid retrieval of relevant news articles. This will significantly enhance search performance and allow users to quickly find articles that match their specific interests.Storage Strategies for Scalability
* **Database** : We will use a scalable database solution like a NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra) that can handle large volumes of data and provide flexible schema management. This will allow us to efficiently store and retrieve news articles while accommodating future growth.
* **Cloud Storage**: For storing large media files (images, videos) associated with news articles, we will leverage cloud storage services like Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage. This will provide high availability, durability, and cost-effective storage.

#### Data Partitioning for Performance
* **Sharding**: If the data volume grows significantly, we will implement sharding based on state or topic. This will distribute the data across multiple database servers, improving performance and scalability. We will carefully manage cross-shard queries to ensure data consistency and efficient retrieval.
* **Archiving**: Based on historical usage patterns, we can archive older or less frequently accessed news articles to less expensive storage solutions (e.g., Amazon Glacier, Google Cloud Storage Nearline). This will free up space in our primary database and optimize storage costs while ensuring that archived data remains accessible when needed.

#### Decoupling Presentation and Data Collection

By decoupling the data presentation layer from the data collection layer, we can independently scale each component based on demand. This will allow us to efficiently handle increased traffic and ensure optimal performance for both data ingestion and user-facing applications.Horizontal Scaling of Presentation Layer

The presentation layer, responsible for serving news articles to users, can be easily scaled horizontally by adding more web servers or application instances. This will ensure that our system can handle a large number of concurrent users and provide a responsive experience even during peak traffic periods.Additional Considerations
* **Caching**: Implementing caching mechanisms at various levels (e.g., database query caching, content caching) can further improve performance by reducing the number of database queries and network requests.
* **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**: Using a CDN to distribute static content (e.g., images, videos) can reduce latency and improve page load times for users in different geographic locations.
* **Load Balancing**: Implementing load balancing across multiple servers can distribute traffic evenly and ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
By implementing these strategies, we can build a scalable and efficient system that can handle thousands of news articles across multiple states and topics, providing a seamless experience for our users.

### Optimizing news article search for large datasets
* **Indexing**: Indexing key fields (state, topic, date) for rapid retrieval.
* **Distributed Architecture**: Using search engines like Elasticsearch or Solr.
* **Query Optimization**: Techniques like rewriting, caching, and index optimization.
* **Relevance Ranking**: Prioritizing results by keyword frequency, popularity, and user preferences.
* **Real-time Indexing**: Near real-time updates for current information.
* **Caching/Load Balancing**: Reducing load and ensuring scalability.

These strategies improve search functionality and enable efficient searching of large news article datasets.
